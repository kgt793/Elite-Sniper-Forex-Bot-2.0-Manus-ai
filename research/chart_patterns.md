# Forex Chart Patterns

Chart patterns are visual formations that appear on price charts and can help traders predict future price movements. They are categorized into three main types:

## Types of Chart Patterns

1. **Continuation Patterns** - Signal that a current trend will continue
   - Ascending Triangle
   - Descending Triangle
   - Symmetrical Triangle (can also be bilateral)
   - Flag
   - Wedge

2. **Reversal Patterns** - Indicate a trend is going to change direction
   - Double Top
   - Double Bottom
   - Head and Shoulders
   - Rounded Top or Bottom
   - Cup and Handle

3. **Bilateral Patterns** - Indicate a market could move in either direction due to volatility
   - Symmetrical Triangle (when no clear trend before pattern)

## Common Chart Patterns

### 1. Ascending and Descending Staircase
- **Ascending Staircase**: Market moving upwards with higher highs and higher lows
- **Descending Staircase**: Market forming lower lows and lower highs
- Trading strategy: Go long in uptrends, short in downtrends
- Dips in uptrends provide buying opportunities, rallies in downtrends provide selling opportunities

### 2. Ascending Triangle
- Created when a horizontal set of highs meets an ascending set of lows
- Upper horizontal line is resistance, lower upward sloping line is support
- Usually a continuation pattern appearing after an uptrend
- Breakout above resistance signals new uptrend
- Volume should decline within pattern and increase during breakout

### 3. Descending Triangle
- Opposite of ascending triangle
- Formed when horizontal set of lows (support) meets descending set of highs (resistance)
- Usually appears after a downtrend
- Breakout below support signals continuation of downtrend
- Volume pattern similar to ascending triangle

### 4. Symmetrical Triangle
- Occurs when two trend lines approach one another
- Can be continuation pattern if there's a prevailing trend
- Bilateral pattern if no clear trend before formation
- Trade in direction of breakout

### 5. Flag
- Support and resistance lines run parallel, sloping upwards or downwards
- Culminates in breakout opposite to trendlines
- **Bullish Flag**: Lines point downwards, breakout through resistance signals uptrend
- **Bearish Flag**: Lines point upwards, breakout through support signals downtrend
- Usually occurs after strong directional move, followed by counter trend

### 6. Wedge
- Similar to flag but lines tighten toward each other
- Often coincides with volume decline
- **Rising Wedge**: Breakout downward through support
- **Falling Wedge**: Breakout upward through resistance
- Can trade oscillations between support and resistance within pattern

### 7. Double Top
- Forms 'M' shape on chart after price reaches two consecutive highs with decline between
- Bearish reversal pattern
- Price expected to fall below support level at low point between highs
- Signals end of buying pressure

### 8. Double Bottom
- Forms 'W' shape on chart
- Bullish reversal pattern
- Price makes two attempts to break support and fails
- Breakout above resistance signals new uptrend

### 9. Head and Shoulders
- Three peaks with middle peak (head) higher than other two (shoulders)
- Bearish reversal pattern when appears at top of uptrend
- Neckline connects lows between peaks
- Breakout below neckline signals downtrend

### 10. Rounded Top or Bottom
- Gradual, curved change in trend direction
- **Rounded Top**: Slow transition from bullish to bearish
- **Rounded Bottom**: Slow transition from bearish to bullish
- Often takes longer to form than other patterns

### 11. Cup and Handle
- Resembles cup with handle on side
- Bullish continuation pattern
- Cup forms rounded bottom, handle forms slight downward drift
- Breakout above resistance signals continuation of uptrend
